## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I created my first graphics design using Microsoft PowerPoint about 4 years ago.
Since then, I've designed flyers, brochures, magazines, etc. and worked with different clients.
I've designed using corelDRAW, Adobe Photoshop, Gravit.io, Adobe XD to name a few.

Determined to design and develop products/services people can use, i finally took a step further to learn how to code.
It is amazing how people create things people use; and i want to be a part of that.ðŸ§®
